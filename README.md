prism is a group-based psuedo-tiling window manager for the X windowing system.

## What the fuck does that mean?

In a nutshell, prism puts windows into groups. Within these groups,
each window is tiled. The gimmick is that while the windows are actually
tiled, the top-level groups follow a floating paradigm.

## For why?

Tiling in groups allows for windows to be easily organized.
This can be useful for windows that take up less screen space, such as
terminal emulators. If a window needs to take up more space, having it be the
only window in a group will make it act like a regular floating window.
