prism is a group-based psuedo-tiling window manager for the X windowing system.

<div align="center">
<h4>What the fuck does that mean?</h4>
</div>

In a nutshell, prism puts windows into groups. Within these groups,
each window is tiled. The gimmick is that while the windows are actually
tiled, the top-level groups follow a floating paradigm.

<div align="center">
<h4>For why?</h4>
</div>

Tiling in groups allows for windows to be easily organized.
This can be useful for windows that take up less screen space, such as
terminal emulators. If a window needs to take up more space, having it be the
only window in a group will make it act like a regular floating window.

prism will be done when I finish it.
For what it's worth, prism is my current focal point for
personal projects.
